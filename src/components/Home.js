                <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>
             I was in the retail industry for 12 years. Customers, whether internal or external have always been my focus. I attended Utah Valley University and received a Bachelors degree in Business Managment with an emphasis in Human Resources graduating in 2008. With that degree I became a Director of the People Department for Harmons. From there, I have worked in the Staffing industry, as well as scheduling for an international company.  I want to challenge myself every day and continue to learn with everything that I do.
